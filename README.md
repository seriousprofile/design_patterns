# design_patterns
this is the most nonchalant guide i've created for myself. 
mainly just includes examples and please note that i've done all this without dividing classes into seperate files. in the real world, you'd have to seperate the classes into files so that your code is clean and easy to understand. 

(remember what robert c martin said: "the only way to measure the quality of the code is the amount of WTFs per minute.")

HOW DID I LEARN? 
- AI
- i made the ai explain it to me like i was 5 years old bc im too stupid for this.
- java has humbled me i have a lot to learn
